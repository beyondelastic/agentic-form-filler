def _try_context_aware_generation(request, document_contents):
    # 1. Detect signing fields using enhanced patterns
    is_signing_location = (
        ('ort' in field_name.lower() and any(num in field_id for num in ['57', '24'])) or
        ('arbeitsort' in field_name.lower())
    )
    
    # 2. Generate appropriate values
    if is_signing_location:
        location = self._extract_employer_location(document_contents)
        return SemanticExtractionResult(confidence=0.95, value=location)
        
    # 3. Dynamic confidence scoring based on multiple factors
    confidence = self._calculate_dynamic_confidence(response_quality, validation_result, context_relevance)
```

### Enhanced Location Extraction Strategy
