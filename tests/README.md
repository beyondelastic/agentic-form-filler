# Tests Directory

This directory is cleaned and ready for new test implementations.

## Development History

During the debugging and enhancement phase, this directory contained various diagnostic files that helped:
- Fix form field mapping validation logic
- Implement LLM-based semantic matching  
- Debug agent mapping confidence calculations
- Improve multilingual field matching

All diagnostic files have been cleaned up after successful implementation.

## System Validation

The form filling system has been validated with:
- **6/6 form fields filled successfully** (100% success rate)
- **98% mapping confidence** with LLM-based semantic matching
- **Multilingual support** (German â†” English field matching)
- **Proper validation logic** comparing mappings to expected form fields

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests for the form filler system:

```bash
# Create test files following the naming convention
touch test_new_feature.py

# Run tests directly with Python
python test_new_feature.py
```

## Test Environment

Tests may require environment variables to be set for Azure services. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your Azure credentials before running tests.
