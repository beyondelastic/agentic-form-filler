# Tests Directory

This directory is ready for test implementations and quality assurance.

## Current Status

The form filling system has been successfully debugged and validated. All temporary diagnostic files have been cleaned up.

## Validation Results

The system has been validated with:
- **✅ Company Field Extraction**: Fixed semantic mapping to correctly distinguish company names from personal names
- **✅ Multi-Strategy Processing**: Azure Document Intelligence + LLM with smart priority logic
- **✅ Context-Aware Field Mapping**: Enhanced field context usage for better accuracy
- **✅ 26/69 fields extracted** with 80% average confidence
- **✅ Smart Priority System**: LLM gets priority for company fields when finding corporate identifiers
- **✅ Multilingual Support**: German ↔ English field matching validated

## Recent Bug Fixes

- Fixed company name field incorrectly extracting personal names
- Enhanced extraction strategy priority for context-specific fields
- Improved field context processing and LLM prompt engineering
- Cleaned up debug code and temporary files

## Future Testing

This directory is prepared for:
- Unit tests for individual agents
- Integration tests for full workflows
- Performance testing for large document batches
- Edge case validation for various document formats
- **Proper validation logic** comparing mappings to expected form fields

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests for the form filler system:

```bash
# Create test files following the naming convention
touch test_new_feature.py

# Run tests directly with Python
python test_new_feature.py
```

## Test Environment

Tests may require environment variables to be set for Azure services. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your Azure credentials before running tests.
